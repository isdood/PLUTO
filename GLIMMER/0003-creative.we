        ## Pattern 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation

        This pattern focuses on dynamically allocating resources based on real-time system load and performance metrics.

        ~story~ = "Dynamic Resource Allocation"

          >>> Monitor system load
          monitor> [
            system_load >measure> real_time |
            threshold >check> [cpu_usage, gpu_usage]
          ]> status

          >>> Reallocate resources
          balance> [
            load_status >analyze> bottlenecks |
            resources >reallocate> [cpu, gpu]

        ## Pattern 3: Secure Execution Environment

        This pattern ensures secure code execution by verifying code integrity, sandboxing execution, and enforcing access controls.

        ~story~ = "Secure Execution Environment"

        @story@
          >>> Verify code integrity
          verify> [
            compiled_code >check> integrity |
