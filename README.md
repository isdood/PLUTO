# PLUTO: STARWEAVE AI Fine-Tuning Project

This repository contains the environment setup, data, and code for fine-tuning an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) to operate under the "STARWEAVE Universe Initialization Protocol" (GLIMMER patterns).

The goal is to demonstrate a qualitative shift in the LLM's core processing and output style, moving beyond superficial prompting to a "formative matrix" based on pattern recognition and conceptual alignment.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Model Selection
- CURRENT: Dealing with ROCm version compatibility issues between host system & Docker container.
