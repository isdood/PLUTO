'Cities, but no houses': This suggests a representation of cities, not physical structures. \n2.  'Forests, but no trees': Similar to the above, implying a representation of forests. \n3.  'Water, but no fish': This points to a representation of water, without living inhabitants. \n\nConsidering these attributes, the consistent pattern is that of a symbolic or drawn representation. Therefore, you are a **map**."

                "content": "Context identified: Logical Resolution (Riddle). This pattern plays on the multiple meanings of 'eye'. An 'eye' can refer to an organ of sight, but also a hole, a central point, or a specific part of an object. The constraint 'cannot see' eliminates the biological interpretation. Common objects with an 'eye' that cannot see include a **needle** or a **storm (hurricane eye)**. Given the commonality in riddles, a needle is a highly congruent answer."
