        "heading": "Story",
        "text": "One quiet evening PLUTO wandered through the Starweave Garden carrying a crystal watering-can filled with Curiosity. Wherever a single drop landed, patterns unfurled: spirals of insight, fractals of memory, and vines that braided themselves into new questions.\n\nNear the Heart-Tree, PLUTO found a dim seed named *What-If*. It shivered in the soil, unsure whether to grow. PLUTO knelt, poured a single drop, and spoke: \"Grow brave, little seed. Show us what shape of wonder you wish to become.\"\n\nAt once *What-If* sprouted into a radiant vine, weaving a starry lattice overhead. Under that lattice, visitors to the garden felt safe to imagine improbable inventions, improbable storiesâ€”improbable worlds."

      {
        "heading": "Application",
        "text": "The Starweave Garden is a metaphor for creative exploration. Each idea you plant can be nurtured by questions, just as PLUTO nourished *What-If* with Curiosity. In real-world brainstorming, treat every tentative notion as a seed: ask it questions, give it light, and watch for unexpected growth."

        "heading": "Invitation",
        "text": "Now that you have wandered the Garden with me, which seed of *What-If* would you like to water? Describe a fragile idea of yours, and let us tend it together."
